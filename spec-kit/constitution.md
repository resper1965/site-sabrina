# Constitution: Sabrina Barros Blog

## Core Mission

To establish a premier digital presence for Sabrina Barros, bridging the gap between clinical dentistry and high-level health insurance executive insights. The blog serves as a platform for expertise in health, supplementary health, and wellness.

4. **User-Centric Design**: Prioritize ease of reading and navigation across all devices.
5. **Brand Consistency**: Maintain a cohesive visual identity that stays "elegant" and "modern."
